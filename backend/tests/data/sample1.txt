Title: Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms are computational methods that enable computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. These algorithms can be broadly categorized into three types:

1. Supervised Learning:
   - Used when data is labeled
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Applications: Spam detection, Price prediction

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - Used with unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality reduction
   - Applications: Customer segmentation, Feature extraction

3. Reinforcement Learning:
   - Learning through interaction with environment
   - Examples: Q-learning, Policy Gradient
   - Applications: Game AI, Robotics

Common evaluation metrics include:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

Best practices for implementation:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature selection
3. Model validation
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Regular model updates
